### React Weather App ###

Bootstrapped with Create-React-App

Simple weather proejct using the users current location.  The purpose fo the projecty was to strengtehen my react API knowledge, create a back end and learn the very simple javascript geoloaction feature.

App still needs styling, all the functinality is there, it just looks very basic at the moment
